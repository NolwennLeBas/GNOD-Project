# GNOD - Song Recommender Project

#### Business goal:

- The detailed Project description can be found in the `case_study_gnod.md` file.

The goal of this project is to build a music recommender that will take a song as an input from the user and will output another song (the recommendation). In most cases, the recommended song will have to be similar to the inputted song, but the CTO thinks that if the song is on the top charts at the moment, the user will also enjoy a recommendation of another song that is popular at the moment.

The top charts songs will be extracted from Popvortex, a website that maintains a weekly Top 100 of "hot" songs here: [http://www.popvortex.com/music/charts/top-100-songs.php](http://www.popvortex.com/music/charts/top-100-songs.php). Another dataset composed of 10 000 songs from Spotify will be used to recommend a song in case the user input is not included in the top100 current chart songs.

The final song recommender can be found in the `song_recommender.ipynb` file. Enjoy the vibes!
